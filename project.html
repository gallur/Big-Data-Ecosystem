<h2><a href="https://gallur.github.io/Movie-Recommender-System/project.html">Movie Recommendation System</a>
  <h3><b>Tech Stack</b>: Python, MRJob, Hadoop, MapReduce. </h3>
  <h3><b>Description</b>: Implemented an algorithm to compute the similarity between movies and created a movie recommendation system which can take any movie as an input and provide similar movies. </h3>

<h2><a href="https://gallur.github.io/GooglePageRank/project.html">Google PageRank Algorithm Implementation</a>
  <h3><b>Tech Stack</b>: Python, MRJob, Hadoop, MapReduce. </h3>
  <h3><b>Description</b>: Implemented the Google PageRank algorithm that decides which websites should rank higher in Google Search suing the concept that a website can be accessed in one of only two ways.</h3>

<h2><a href="https://gallur.github.io/Finding-Euler-Graphs/project.html">Finding Euler Graphs</a>
  <h3><b>Tech Stack</b>: Python, MRJob, Hadoop, MapReduce. </h3>
  <h3><b>Description</b>: An algorithm that tells us whether a given graph of size and complexity, is a Euler graph or not. In other words, it tells us whether this graph can be traversed without having to traverse an edge twice. </h3>
  
  <h2><a href="https://gallur.github.io/ETL-iTunes-Hive/project.html">Web Scraping of iTunes and Building of ETL Pipleing using Hive</a>
  <h3><b>Tech Stack</b>: Python, Scrapy, AWS ElasticMapReduce, Apache Hive, HiveQL, xPATH, AWS S3. </h3>
  <h3><b>Description</b>: Built a pipeline to extract data from multiple levels of links on iTunes website and clean the data and load to S3 and then create tables from this data on Hive over EMR so that my team could perform analytic operations on data.</h3>
